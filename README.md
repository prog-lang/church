# Church Programming Language

**Church** is a simple, safe, fast, purely functional programming language
that compiles to [WebAssembly][wa]. It is built to run _everywhere_, including

1. web browsers
2. server machines
3. blockchain contracts
4. IoT devices

and other platforms that can host a WASM runtime.

## 🚨 Under Construction

Church is being actively developed and is, therefore, _very_ unstable. Use with
caution and, preferably, for experiments only.

## 🏔️ Guiding Principles

😇 **Simple:** just like $\lambda$-calculus, Church is concise and
straightforward. It handles complex tasks through abstraction and composition
aided by its powerful type system.

🔒 **Safe:** Church's function purity and rich type checker eliminate a wide
range of bugs and inconsistencies right off the bat. The compiler is going to
gently guide you on your way to the top.

⚡ **Fast:** last but not least, Church targets WebAssembly to combine execution
speed with the ability to execute on multiple platforms.
